# Saisrijith Reddy Maramreddy – Resume

This repository contains my personal resume website built using the [modern-resume-theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme) Jekyll template, hosted via GitHub Pages.

The site showcases my professional background, education, technical skills, and certifications with a clean and responsive layout.

## 🖼️ How It Works

This resume is configured entirely through `_config.yml`. You can update:

- Personal info & photo
- Sections under the `content:` block (Experience, Education, Skills, etc.)
- Theme & layout settings

No need to touch `index.md` — this theme renders content via the config file.
